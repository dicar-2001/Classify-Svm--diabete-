## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that poses a significant health risk worldwide. This project employs a machine learning approach to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on their medical attributes. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and achieve robust classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes medical attributes like:
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Insulin level
- Age
- Other health indicators

### Source
The dataset can be found in [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) (or specify your dataset source).
